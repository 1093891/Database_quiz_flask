q16,true_false,hard,"RAID 0 (Striping) provides excellent fault tolerance because data is mirrored across multiple disks.",,false,"False. RAID 0 (Striping) offers high performance but provides *no* fault tolerance. If any single disk fails, all data is lost. Fault tolerance is provided by mirroring (RAID 1) or parity (RAID 5/6)."

q20,true_false,hard,"Two-Phase Locking (2PL) can cause cascading rollbacks if a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction that later aborts.",,true,"True. If a transaction reads uncommitted data (dirty read) from another transaction that later rolls back, the first transaction may also need to roll back, leading to cascading rollbacks. Strict 2PL prevents this."

q72,true_false,hard,"A business rule like 'Customers whose account balances are 90 days overdue will not be permitted to charge additional orders' can typically be fully diagrammed within an ERD.",,false,"False. This is a procedural business rule with time-based logic and conditions that often require additional programming to implement, rather than being fully represented in a static ERD."

q82,true_false,hard,"Optimistic Concurrency Control is generally more efficient in environments with very high data contention and frequent conflicts.",,false,"False. Optimistic Concurrency Control performs better in environments with *low* data contention, as its rollback rate increases significantly with frequent conflicts due to validations at commit time."

q92,true_false,hard,"The principle of 'No Preemption' in deadlock conditions means that resources can be forcibly taken away from a transaction.",,false,"False. 'No Preemption' means that resources *cannot* be forcibly taken away from a transaction that is holding them. This is one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur."
q93,mcq,hard,"What does the SQL query `SELECT DISTINCT SID FROM Suppliers x WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM parts y WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT SID FROM suppliers z WHERE z.sid = x.sid AND z.pid = y.pid ))` achieve?", "It finds suppliers who supply at least one part.|It finds suppliers who supply no parts.|It finds suppliers who supply all parts.|It finds parts supplied by all suppliers.",2,"This SQL query is a common way to simulate the Relational Algebra Division operation, finding entities (suppliers) that are associated with all instances of another entity (parts)."
q94,true_false,hard,"In data modeling, 'UID' stands for 'Unique Identifier'.",,true,"True. UID is commonly used in data modeling to refer to a Unique Identifier, often equivalent to a Primary Key in a relational database."
q95,mcq,hard,"When designing a database, what is the process of organizing attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and handle anomalies?", "Indexing|Partitioning|Normalization|Denormalization",2,"Normalization is the systematic process of structuring a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity."
q96,true_false,hard,"The concept of 'Additional Programming' for business rules refers exclusively to rules that can be fully modeled in an ERD but need a programming language to execute.",,false,"False. Additional programming is typically needed for procedural rules that *cannot* be fully modeled in an ERD (e.g., complex calculations, time-dependent logic), meaning they need to be implemented as processes that interact with data."
q97,mcq,hard,"Which type of query language is PROLOG an example of?", "3GL|4GL|5GL|Procedural Language",2,"PROLOG (PROgramming LOGic) is mentioned as an example of a 5GL, which is a programming language based on problem-solving using constraints, still at an early stage."
q98,true_false,hard,"The `COUNT` aggregate function can only be used on primary key attributes.",,false,"False. `COUNT` can be used on any attribute (or `COUNT(*)`) to count the number of values or rows, not just primary key attributes."
q99,mcq,hard,"What is the term for logging all operations performed on a database to enable recovery and auditing?", "Checkpointing|Mirroring|Journaling|Striping",2,"Journaling, or logging, involves maintaining a transaction log that records all changes made to the database, which is crucial for recovery (rollback/redo) and auditing."
q100,drag_drop,hard,"Match the query language type to its description.","drag1:Procedural Query language|drag2:Non-procedural query language;drop1:User tells what data to be retrieved and how to retrieve it.|drop2:User tells what data to be retrieved but doesn't tell how to retrieve it.;drag1:drop1|drag2:drop2","","Procedural Query language: User tells what data to be retrieved and how to retrieve it. Non-procedural query language: User tells what data to be retrieved but doesn't tell how to retrieve it."
